This directory contains a number of samples that illustrate the use of DexGuard.
Each sample is essentially the same HelloWorld activity, demonstrating
different layers of obfuscation in subsequent steps.

- HelloWorld     : a simple application, set up to be processed by DexGuard.
- EncryptStrings : letting DexGuard encrypt the "Hello world!" string.
- EncryptClasses : letting DexGuard encrypt the SecretClass class.
- Reflection     : letting DexGuard introduce reflection for some API calls,
                   and then further encrypt them.
- MarketLicensing: the sample of the License Verification Library for the
                   Google Play market, with a configuration to let DexGuard
                   harden it against hackers.

You can try the applications in Eclipse (with the DexGuard plugin),
or with Ant (in the respective directories):

1) Make sure the property sdk.dir is set in the file local.properties.
2) Type the following: ant release install
3) Try the HelloWorld application on your device or in the emulator.

You can see the differences in configuration in the dexguard-project.txt files.
