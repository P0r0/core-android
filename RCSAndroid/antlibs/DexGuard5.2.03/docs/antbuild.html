<h2>Ant Build</h2>

<h3>Setting Up the Ant Build</h3>

If you develop your applications with the Ant build process of the Android
SDK Tools (revision 21.0.0 or higher), you can enable DexGuard as follows:
<ol>
<li>Copy the two configuration files from DexGuard's <code>ant</code>
    directory to the main directory of your Android project:
<pre>
dexguard-project.txt
custom_rules.xml
</pre></li>
<li>Specify the main DexGuard directory on your system in the configuration
    file <code>local.properties</code> in your Android project. For instance:
<pre>
dexguard.dir=/usr/local/DexGuard5.0
</pre></li>
</ol>

The standard Ant build process will now automatically use DexGuard for your
Android project. You'll see this in the build process:
the lines with <code>[dexguard]</code> in the console replace all lines with
<code>[proguard]</code>, <code>[dex]</code>, <code>[dx]</code>,
<code>[apkbuilder]</code>, <code>[signjar]</code>, and
<code>[zip-align]</code>.
<p>

DexGuard is most commonly applied to final <i>application projects</i>, but it
can also be applied to <i>library projects</i>, if the library jar is the
final product. The former case is the easiest and most effective, since it
processes the combined code in a single step. In the latter case, you should
take some care with class encryption, as discussed with
the <a href="usage.html#encryptclasses">class encryption option</a>.
Furthermore, tamper detection is only supported if the final application is
also built and packaged using DexGuard.

<h3>Building</h3>

The procedure for building Android applications remains essentially the same.
You can invoke <code>ant</code> with the usual targets <code>debug</code>
and <code>release</code>. Debug builds use debug settings, without
optimization or obfuscation. Release builds use release settings, with full
optimization and obfuscation. Both types of builds can optionally be signed.
Both types of builds create application archives with aligned entries.
<p>

The Ant build picks up custom configurations from the following optional files
in your Android project:
<pre>
dexguard-project.txt         (for all targets)
dexguard-project-debug.txt   (for target 'debug')
dexguard-project-release.txt (for target 'release')
proguard-project.txt         (for backward compatibility with ProGuard)
</pre>
The default version of the first file contains a number of settings that can be enabled to perform string encryption, class encryption, and to hide access to sensitive APIs.
<p>

<h3>Further tips</h3>

As before, you can specify some useful properties in the Ant configuration
file <code>local.properties</code>:
<ul class="spacious">
<li>If you want to get verbose output for the entire build process, including
    DexGuard, you can add this line:
<pre>
verbose = true
</pre></li>
<li>If you want to sign your application, you can specify all or some of the
    necessary properties. For example:
<pre>
key.store          = /home/user/.android/debug.keystore
key.store.password = android
key.alias          = AndroiddebugKey
key.alias.password = android
</pre>
If you don't specify passwords, the build process will ask for them.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Reverting to the traditional Ant Build</h3>

You can go back to the basic Ant build of the Android SDK by removing or
renaming the custom rules file <code>custom_rules.xml</code> in the main
directory of your Android project.
