This directory contains a number of samples that illustrate the use of DexGuard.
The first samples are essentially the same HelloWorld activity, demonstrating
different layers of obfuscation in subsequent steps. The other samples show
how to protect libraries that are common in real-world applications.

- HelloWorld       : A simple application, set up to be processed by DexGuard.
- StringEncryption : Let DexGuard encrypt the "Hello world!" string.
- ClassEncryption  : Let DexGuard encrypt the SecretClass class.
- Reflection       : Let DexGuard introduce reflection for some API calls,
                     and then further encrypt them.
- DebugDetection   : Detect whether the application is debuggable, and let
                     DexGuard hide it.
- EmulatorDetection: Detect whether the application is running in an emulator,
                     and let DexGuard hide it.
- TamperDetection  : Detect whether the apk archive has been tampered with,
                     after it has been created by DexGuard.
- MarketDetection  : Detect whether the application originates from the Google
                     Play market, and let DexGuard hide it.
- MarketLicensing  : The sample of the License Verification Library for the
                     Google Play market, with a DexGuard configuration to
                     harden it against hackers.
- MarketExpansion  : The sample of the APK Expansion Library for the
                     Google Play market, again with a DexGuard configuration
                     to harden it.
- AdMob            : A sample that uses Google's AdMob advertisement library,
                     again with a DexGuard configuration to harden it.

You can try the applications in Eclipse (with the DexGuard plugin),
or with Ant (in the respective directories):

1) Make sure the property sdk.dir is set in the file local.properties.
2) Type the following: ant release install
3) Try the HelloWorld application on your device or in the emulator.

You can see the differences in configuration in the dexguard-project.txt files.
